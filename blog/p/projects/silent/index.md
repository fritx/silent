# silent

> Be a silent, static blog

See live demo: [here](http://fritx.github.io/silent)

## Features

### Easy: Writing in Markdown

Or you can use other renderer instead

All you need to do is rewrite at most **2** functions

### Flexible: Special Page Mastering

> Everything is a page

Everything is under one folder

### Lightweight: You Can't Imagine

> 1 html, 1 css and 2 js, totally **5K** (excluding jquery & marked)

See what, here's a sample of the folders, and nothing else:

- blog/
  - p/ (your own things, free to handle)
    - posts/
      - my-js-book/
        - index.md
        - part-1.md
        - part-2.md
      - what-a-funny-day.md
      - why-i-use-js.md
    - sidebar.md
    - aboutme.md
    - avatar.jpg
  - vendor/ (built-in stuffs)
